## This is a project from my Design of Expirments class (MA 255)
This report is for a video streaming service (Webflicks) that looks to maximize views on their shows. 
Webflicks uses three different release schedules for their shows (Drop, Dual Drop, and Weekly). 
They also release shows of different genres, and suspect there may be an interaction effect between genre and release schedule. 
I use power analysis for this experiment, two-way ANOVA with interaction analysis, and post-hoc analyses to understand how Webflicks can increase views on their shows.
